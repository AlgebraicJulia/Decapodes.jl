Decapods are a graphical tool for the composition of physical systems.
Ultimately, this library will include tooling which takes advantage of the
formalization of physical theories described by DEC provided by
[CombinatorialSpaces.jl](https://algebraicjulia.github.io/CombinatorialSpaces.jl/dev/).

# NOTE
This library is currently under active development, and so is not yet at a
point where a constant API/behavior can be assumed. That being said, if this
project looks interesting/relevant please contact us and
[let us know](https://www.algebraicjulia.org/#contributing)!
