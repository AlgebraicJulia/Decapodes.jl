	abstract = {Abstract. An accurate ice thickness distribution is crucial for correct
projections of the future state of an ice mass. However, measuring the ice
thickness with an in situ system is time-consuming and not scalable.
Therefore, models have been developed to estimate the ice thickness without
direct measurements. In this study, we reconstruct the ice thickness of the
Grigoriev ice cap, Kyrgyzstan, from in situ observations and the yield
stress method. We compare the results with data from six global ice thickness
datasets composed without the use of our local measurements. The results
highlight the limitations of these generic datasets primarily stemming from
the subdivision of ice caps into distinct glaciers, the adoption of a
(calibrated) creep parameter value, assumptions regarding ice mass flux, and
errors regarding surface velocity observations. These shortcomings
emphasize the importance of integrating local observations to
calibrate models to achieve precise representations of ice thickness,
particularly when dealing with smaller or slow-flowing cold ice caps, such
as the Grigoriev ice cap.},

	abstract = {Abstract. We describe and evaluate version 2.1 of the Community Ice Sheet Model (CISM).
CISM is a parallel, 3-D thermomechanical model, written mainly in Fortran,
that solves equations for the momentum balance and the thickness and
temperature evolution of ice sheets. CISM's velocity solver incorporates a
hierarchy of Stokes flow approximations, including shallow-shelf,
depth-integrated higher order, and 3-D higher order. CISM also includes a
suite of test cases, links to third-party solver libraries, and
parameterizations of physical processes such as basal sliding, iceberg
calving, and sub-ice-shelf melting. The model has been verified for standard
test problems, including the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for
Higher-Order Models (ISMIP-HOM) experiments, and has participated in the
initMIP-Greenland initialization experiment. In
multimillennial simulations with modern climate forcing on a 4 km grid, CISM
reaches a steady state that is broadly consistent with observed flow patterns
of the Greenland ice sheet. CISM has been integrated into version 2.0 of the
Community Earth System Model, where it is being used for Greenland
simulations under past, present, and future climates. The code is open-source
with extensive documentation and remains under active development.},

              Regular vegetation patterns appear on aerial views of plateaux in SW Niger where densely and sparsely populated zones alternate with each other. This spatial organization of the vegetation is an endogenous phenomenon which is not limited to specific plants or soils; it is a characteristic landscape of many arid regions throughout the world. The phenomenon is interpreted as the result of a spatial range difference between two biologically distinct interactions operating at the plant population level. The proposed mechanism is independent of external heterogeneities deriving from soil geomorphology or meteorology. We present a model to simulate the genesis of vegetation stripes. In addition, the model predicts the occurrence of vegetation hexagons corresponding to higher or lower density spots arranged in a hexagonal lattice. The distinction between the two spatial symmetries is discussed in terms of their Fourier transforms.},

	abstract = {Vegetation in many semiarid regions is strikingly patterned, forming regular stripes on hillsides and irregular mosaics on flat ground. A simple model of plant and water dynamics based on ecologically realistic assumptions and with reasonable parameter values captures both of these types of patterns. The regular patterns result from a Turing-like instability; the irregular patterns arise when the ecological dynamics amplify slight small-scale topographic variability. Because of the close agreement between observations and these theoretical results, this system provides a clear example of how nonlinear mechanisms can be important in determining the spatial structure of plant communities.},
