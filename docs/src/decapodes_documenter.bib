	abstract = {Increasing knowledge of intertumor heterogeneity, intratumor heterogeneity, and cancer evolution has improved the understanding of anticancer treatment resistance. A better characterization of cancer evolution and subsequent use of this knowledge for personalized treatment would increase the chance to overcome cancer treatment resistance. Model‐based approaches may help achieve this goal. In this review, we comprehensively summarized mathematical models of tumor dynamics for solid tumors and of drug resistance evolution. Models displayed by ordinary differential equations, algebraic equations, and partial differential equations for characterizing tumor burden dynamics are introduced and discussed. As for tumor resistance evolution, stochastic and deterministic models are introduced and discussed. The results may facilitate a novel model‐based analysis on anticancer treatment response and the occurrence of resistance, which incorporates both tumor dynamics and resistance evolution. The opportunities of a model‐based approach as discussed in this review can be of great benefit for future optimizing and personalizing anticancer treatment.},

In particular, that process can be modeled by a partial differential interaction–diffusion equation system for the plant biomass density and the surface water content defined on an unbounded flat spatial domain. The main results of this analysis can be represented by closed-form plots in the rate of precipitation versus the specific rate of plant density loss parameter space. From these plots, regions corresponding to bare ground and vegetative patterns consisting of parallel stripes, labyrinth-like mazes, hexagonal arrays of gaps, irregular mosaics, and homogeneous distributions of vegetation, respectively, may be identified in this parameter space. Then those theoretical predictions are compared with both relevant observational evidence involving tiger and pearled bush patterns and existing numerical simulations of similar model systems as well as placed in the context of the results from some recent nonlinear vegetative pattern formation studies.},

	abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on 
              Hydra 
              and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

CISM is a parallel, 3-D thermomechanical model, written mainly in Fortran,
that solves equations for the momentum balance and the thickness and
temperature evolution of ice sheets. CISM's velocity solver incorporates a
hierarchy of Stokes flow approximations, including shallow-shelf,
depth-integrated higher order, and 3-D higher order. CISM also includes a
suite of test cases, links to third-party solver libraries, and
parameterizations of physical processes such as basal sliding, iceberg
calving, and sub-ice-shelf melting. The model has been verified for standard
test problems, including the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for
Higher-Order Models (ISMIP-HOM) experiments, and has participated in the
initMIP-Greenland initialization experiment. In
multimillennial simulations with modern climate forcing on a 4 km grid, CISM
reaches a steady state that is broadly consistent with observed flow patterns
of the Greenland ice sheet. CISM has been integrated into version 2.0 of the
Community Earth System Model, where it is being used for Greenland
simulations under past, present, and future climates. The code is open-source
with extensive documentation and remains under active development.},

              Regular vegetation patterns appear on aerial views of plateaux in SW Niger where densely and sparsely populated zones alternate with each other. This spatial organization of the vegetation is an endogenous phenomenon which is not limited to specific plants or soils; it is a characteristic landscape of many arid regions throughout the world. The phenomenon is interpreted as the result of a spatial range difference between two biologically distinct interactions operating at the plant population level. The proposed mechanism is independent of external heterogeneities deriving from soil geomorphology or meteorology. We present a model to simulate the genesis of vegetation stripes. In addition, the model predicts the occurrence of vegetation hexagons corresponding to higher or lower density spots arranged in a hexagonal lattice. The distinction between the two spatial symmetries is discussed in terms of their Fourier transforms.},

projections of the future state of an ice mass. However, measuring the ice
thickness with an in situ system is time-consuming and not scalable.
Therefore, models have been developed to estimate the ice thickness without
direct measurements. In this study, we reconstruct the ice thickness of the
Grigoriev ice cap, Kyrgyzstan, from in situ observations and the yield
stress method. We compare the results with data from six global ice thickness
datasets composed without the use of our local measurements. The results
highlight the limitations of these generic datasets primarily stemming from
the subdivision of ice caps into distinct glaciers, the adoption of a
(calibrated) creep parameter value, assumptions regarding ice mass flux, and
errors regarding surface velocity observations. These shortcomings
emphasize the importance of integrating local observations to
calibrate models to achieve precise representations of ice thickness,
particularly when dealing with smaller or slow-flowing cold ice caps, such
as the Grigoriev ice cap.},
