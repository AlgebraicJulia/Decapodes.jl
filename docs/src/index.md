# Decapodes.jl

Decapodes are a graphical tool for the composition of physical systems.
Ultimately, this library will include tooling which takes advantage of the
formalization of physical theories described by DEC provided by
[CombinatorialSpaces.jl](https://algebraicjulia.github.io/CombinatorialSpaces.jl/dev/).

# Getting started

Walkthroughs creating, composing, and solving Decapodes are available in the side-bar of this documentation page. Further example scripts are avaiable in the `examples` folder of the Decapodes.jl GitHub repo, and will be added to this documentation site soon.

# NOTE
This library is currently under active development, and so is not yet at a
point where a constant API/behavior can be assumed. That being said, if this
project looks interesting/relevant please contact us and
[let us know](https://www.algebraicjulia.org/#contributing)!
