Currently, these features are the treatment of boundary conditions and the simulation debugger interface. To begin, we set up the same advection-diffusion problem presented in the Overview section. As before, we define the Diffusion, Advection, and Superposition components, and now include a BC (Bounday Condition) component. Decapodes.jl interprets any Hom which begins with a ∂ as a boundary condition. These boundary conditions recieve special treatment at the scheduling step. Below we show the graphical rendering of this boundary condition diagram, which we will use to impose a Dirichlet condition on the time derivative of concentration at the mesh boundary.","category":"page"},{"location":"bc_debug/","page":"Misc Features","title":"Misc Features","text":"using Catlab\nusing Catlab.Graphics\nusing DiagrammaticEquations\nusing DiagrammaticEquations.Deca\nusing Decapodes\n\nDiffusion = @decapode begin\n  C::Form0\n  ϕ::Form1\n\n  # Fick's first law\n  ϕ ==  k(d₀(C))\nend\n\nAdvection = @decapode begin\n  C::Form0\n  ϕ::Form1\n  V::Constant\n\n  ϕ == ∧₀₁(C,V)\nend\n\nSuperposition = @decapode begin\n  (C, C_up)::Form0\n  (ϕ, ϕ₁, ϕ₂)::Form1\n\n  ϕ == ϕ₁ + ϕ₂\n  C_up == ⋆₀⁻¹(dual_d₁(⋆₁(ϕ)))\nend\n\nBoundaryConditions = @decapode begin\n  (C, C_up)::Form0\n\n  # Temporal boundary\n  ∂ₜ(C) == Ċ\n\n  # Spatial boundary\n  Ċ == ∂C(C_up)\nend\n\nto_graphviz(BoundaryConditions)","category":"page"},{"location":"bc_debug/","page":"Misc Features","title":"Misc Features","text":"As before, we compose these physics components over our wiring diagram.","category":"page"},{"location":"bc_debug/","page":"Misc Features","title":"Misc Features","text":"compose_diff_adv = @relation (C, V) begin\n  diffusion(C, ϕ₁)\n  advection(C, ϕ₂, V)\n  bc(C, C_up)\n  superposition(ϕ₁, ϕ₂, ϕ, C_up, C)\nend\n\nto_graphviz(compose_diff_adv, box_labels=:name, junction_labels=:variable, prog=\"circo\")","category":"page"},{"location":"bc_debug/","page":"Misc Features","title":"Misc Features","text":"DiffusionAdvection_cospan = oapply(compose_diff_adv,\n                  [Open(Diffusion, [:C, :ϕ]),\n                   Open(Advection, [:C, :ϕ, :V]),\n                   Open(BoundaryConditions, [:C, :C_up]),\n                   Open(Superposition, [:ϕ₁, :ϕ₂, :ϕ, :C_up, :C])])\nDiffusionAdvection = apex(DiffusionAdvection_cospan)\n\nto_graphviz(DiffusionAdvection)","category":"page"},{"location":"bc_debug/","page":"Misc Features","title":"Misc Features","text":"When this is scheduled, Decapodes will apply any boundary conditions immediately after the impacted value is computed.
